In this fMRI study, we investigated how beliefs about sensory uncertainty influence early visual information processing. We used unreliable feedback interventions (in which invalid feedback was given on 50% of trials) to induce such beliefs and used reliable feedback as a control condition. The experiment used a between-group design, and fMRI data from 29 healthy human participants (n= 15 in the unreliable feedback group, 14 in the control/ reliable feedback group) were obtained. Participants performed a challenging visual orientation discrimination task by identifying visual gratings presented in circular annuli (inner r = 1.32°, outer r = 6.69°) as clockwise or counter-clockwise with reference to one of two implicit diagonal references (45° or 135°). The stimuli deviated from the diagonals by an angle defined prior to the main part of the experiment using a staircase procedure. The main part of the experiment had three phases (1) a baseline pre-intervention phase (no fb), (2) an intervention phase with reliable/unreliable fb and (3) a post-intervention phase (no fb). The main analyses of interest is the comparison of pre/post intervention changes in behaviour and pattern distinctness between the reliable and unreliable feedback groups. 

Here the following data and codes are given:

BEHAVIOURAL
behavioural_performance.m : code showing the estimation of task performance from the raw data (data_across_blocks_and_subjects.mat). Run-wise estimates of task performance provided in tbl_DV1.mat.

Data organisation in data_across_blocks_and_subjects.mat :
Aalldata is a cell comprsing raw data. Rows: subject indices (6-35. Reliable group: 7,9,..., unreliable group: 6,8,...) and columns: run number (1-24).

Each cell consists of 2D matrices with rows as the number of trials (with responses) and columns as the following: (run number (1-8), trial number (1-32),stimulus type (1-4), response type after correcting for the random response mapping (1-2), response mapping (1-2), trial onset time, stimulus onset time, response onset time.

FMRI
fmri_cvMANOVA_code.m : shows the invocation of the cvMANOVA algorithm for the ROI and searchlight analyses

fmri_extract_anat_visual_voxels.m : creation of the V1 mask from the probabilistic map.

fmri_univariate_analysis_V1.m : code showing univariate analysis of V1 voxels.

cvMANOVA_V1_ROI_analysis.csv : pattern distinctness estimates for each test phase (columns 1 and 2) for reliable/unreliable feedback (column 3; 1:reliable fb, 2:unreliable fb). Other columns are as follows: column 4: threshold angular deviation of stimuli from the 45° or 135° references , column 5 and 6: task performance pre- and post-intervention, column 7: index to select or exclude participants (1: selected participants), column 8 and 9 differences between rows 1 and 2, and 5 and 6, respectively. Rows show participants.
